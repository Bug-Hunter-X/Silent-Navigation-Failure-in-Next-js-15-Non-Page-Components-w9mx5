In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using the `next/navigation` client-side routing features within a component that's not directly rendered by a `Page` component.  This can occur with components used in modals, dialogs, or other situations where they aren't a part of the main page hierarchy.  The error manifests as the navigation not working correctly or throwing unexpected errors, often without a clear indication of the underlying issue.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage in a non-page component
function MyModal({ onClose }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleNavigate = () => {
    router.push('/home'); // This might fail
    onClose();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleNavigate}>Navigate</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
